# zephyr_microchip-mcp3425
This is a driver implementation of the Microchip single ADC MCP3425 driver, create for the 6TRON ecosystem.

## Requirements
### Hardware requirements for sample example
The following boards are required for the sample to work:
- *Any Zest Core board*
- *Zest Actuator HalfBridges*

### Software requirements
This implementation uses Zephyr framework v3.5.0.

For easy installation, we provide a [custom zephyr workspace](https://github.com/catie-aq/zephyr_manifest) which will automatically import our [6TRON ecosystem manifest](https://github.com/catie-aq/zephyr_6tron-manifest).
