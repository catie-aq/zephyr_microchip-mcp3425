      - 14
      - 16
  pga_gain:
    required: false
    type: int
    default: 1
    description: Set the PGA Gain before the analog conversion. This is useful to convert a smaller input signal with high resolution. Correct values are 1 (default), 2, 4 or 8.
    enum:
      - 1
      - 2
      - 4
      - 8
